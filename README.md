## About The Project
Comisite is the site that delivers comics to your inbox to keep you entertained throughout the day. Living in a Fast-Paced World, with lots of workload and pressure, we bring you a bunch of puns to help you survive the day.

This is a PHP based project, once you connect with us we bring comic's to your inbox every five minutes. All you have to do is sign up and subscribe to our mailing service to get started.

Waiting for you on the other side.
