## Problem Statement
##### 1. Email a random XKCD challenge
Please create a simple PHP application that accepts a visitor's email address and emails them random XKCD comics every five minutes.

1. Your app should include email verification to avoid people using othersâ€™ email addresses.
2. XKCD image should go as an email attachment as well as inline image content.
3. You can visit https://c.xkcd.com/random/comic/ programmatically to return a random comic URL and then use JSON API for details https://xkcd.com/json.html
4. Please make sure your emails contain an unsubscribe link so a user can stop getting emails.

Since this is a simple project it must be done in core PHP including API calls, recurring emails, including attachments should happen in core PHP. Please do not use any libraries.
